# US-Income-Data
In this data study I will creat a dataframe with files were obtained from the federal reserve to visualize the median income of different states using Matplotlib. 
After visualizing these datasets, the program will asses the data from the selected states and return the state with the highest average year-by-year growth and present its growth rate.
